    <p class="q">What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</p>
    <p>Prior to taking PROG 109 (Intro to Web Development) at Bellevue College, I had no prevoius<br>
        knowledge of HTML, CSS or Javascript</p>
    <p class="q">Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</p>
    <p>For the creation of my portfolio, I used a template provided by my professor.</p>
    <p class="q">What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</p>
    <p>The most challenging part of my portfolio was the organization prior to building the website.</p>
    <p class="q">How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</p>
    <p>Taking this class changed my perspective on the difficulty of Web Development. Before taking <br>
    this class I thought that coding was difficult but I have learned that practicing is the key</p>
    <p class="q">What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</p>
    <p>I would recommend to use the tutoring center at Bellevue College. Don't feel afraid of asking<br>
    question as it is normal to feel lost or confused at first. Be kind to yourself and take your time
understand what you are doing.</p>
